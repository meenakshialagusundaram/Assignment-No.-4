#The graph above serves as a visual representation of how socio-economic factors, specifically poverty rates, correlate with educational outcomes, as measured by literacy rates. The graph aims to understand how educational outcomes vary according to literacy states in states in India. Each point on the graph represents a state, with its position determined by its poverty rate (horizontal placement) and literacy rate (vertical placement) for the year 2014.States with lower poverty rates tend to have higher literacy rates as compared to states with higher poverty rates.

#The graph aims to understand the difference in female labor force participation in the most urban state (Kerala) and most rural state (Bihar)in India over the years 2014-2017. The graph reveals a stark contrast between the two states, with Kerala consistently showing higher female labor force participation (over 30%) rates compared to Bihar (below 5%).However, a limitation of the dataset is the lack of variation in the values through the years for each state, suggesting either a stagnation in female labor force participation rates during this period or a limitation in the dataset's ability to capture year-over-year changes.

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = pcg_p60g8)) +
  geom_density(na.rm = TRUE, fill = "light green", alpha = 0.5) + 
  theme_classic() +
  labs(x = "Percentage of scores", title = "Percentage of grade 8 female students scoring 60% and above") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"))
  
```

# This density plot shows the percentage of female students who have scored more than 60% in their grade 8 exams. We are interested in understanding the distribution of these scores since the data also attempts to see what factors affect the improvement of scores in girls such as the percentage of female teachers. This data aims to understand how female literacy and labor force participation is impacted when women are elected into government roles. 

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

# In the 2014 general elections in India, the Baratiya Janata Party (BJP) which won the elections ran a campaign with the idea of development of poor states. This graph tries to analyse the correlation between the poverty rate of the 28 states and the percentage of BJP votes in each state. The teal colored columns show states below the mean poverty rate, and the salmon colored columns show states above the mean poverty rate. The states are reordered to analyze those with the lowest vote percentage for BJP and those with the BJP. Even though it was expected that several more salmon colored columns would be towards the right side of the distribution, the data presents a different story.
